# 🧠 Adaptive Dynamic Pricing Based on Customer Sensitivity

This project explores how adaptive pricing strategies can be used to optimize revenue in e-commerce by learning from customer behavior. Using real-world Amazon survey data, customers are segmented by their price sensitivity, and three dynamic pricing algorithms are compared.
