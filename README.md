# Adaptive Dynamic Pricing Based on Customer Sensitivity

This project explores how adaptive pricing strategies (Epsilon-Greedy, UCB, and Thompson Sampling) can be optimized using customer segmentation derived from real-world demographic and behavioral data.

- 📊 Customer Segmentation with KMeans and PCA
- 🧠 Behavioral Labels: Elastic, Moderate, Inelastic
- 🎯 Dynamic Pricing Simulations (1000 arrivals, non-stationary demand)
- 📈 Comparison of Regret and Revenue across algorithms
